# Ledger

A running log of load-bearing design decisions — the ones that would be
expensive to silently re-litigate in a later sprint. One entry per sprint,
newest first. Not a changelog (that's `CHANGELOG.md`) — this is *why*, not
*what*.

## Sprint 1 — Prompt Templates (`crates/lopi-core/src/template.rs`)

**Decision:** escaping follows Rust's `format!` rule — `{{` and `}}` decode to
a literal `{` / `}`, independently of hole-matching (not a paired
`{{...}}` block). And: stop at a bare `resolve()` fn — no `PromptTemplate`
newtype.

**Why:** the escape rule is copied wholesale from a convention every
Rust contributor to this repo already knows (`format!`/`println!`), so there's
no new grammar to learn or document — `{{brace}}` reads as "the same rule as
`format!`" instead of a bespoke invention. The fn-vs-newtype call: a newtype
would only earn its keep once templates carry state beyond the string itself
(a source location, a cached parse, validation metadata) — none of which this
sprint's four call sites need. Building it now would be exactly the kind of
premature abstraction CLAUDE.md warns against; the moment a second sprint
needs more than a `&str` in, `String` (or `Result`) out, promote it then.

**How to apply:** any future sprint that touches template syntax (nested
holes, default values, conditional holes) must extend this same escape rule
rather than introducing a second one — and should re-examine the newtype
question at that point, not before.
